# Heart Disease EDA

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset related to heart disease. The goal is to analyze the dataset, find meaningful insights, and visualize key patterns that could help in understanding factors contributing to heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various health-related attributes such as **age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate,** and other significant indicators related to heart disease.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and incorrect data entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating statistical summaries, distributions, and correlations.
- **Visualizations**: Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize trends, relationships, and patterns.
- **Feature Correlation Analysis**: Identifying key factors contributing to heart disease.
- **Statistical Insights**: Finding significant attributes affecting heart disease.

## Dependencies
To run this project, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Magnus0969/Heart-Diease-EDA.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Heart-Diease-EDA
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts:
```bash
jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_EDA.ipynb
```

## Results
The project provides insights into:
- The distribution of heart disease cases based on various features.
- Correlation between different health metrics and heart disease.
- Visualizations highlighting key risk factors.
